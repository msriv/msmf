    about:
      "Multiple imaging systems, a portable OCT device, and a mobile-phone based system were evaluated for their efficacy in efficacy in delineation of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). The portable OCT system integrated with ANN-based analysis delineated high-grade dysplasia with high sensitivity (83%), which in turn can be employed to triage patients for tertiary care referral (James et al., 2021). Additionally, a customized dual-modality mobile oral screening device in combination with an efficient MobileNet in a lite format, achieved 81% accuracy for distinguishing normal/benign lesions from clinically suspicious lesions, using a gold standard of clinical impression based on the review of images by oral specialists.",

    about:
      "We have developed a 3D cell system based on gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels and are studying them to understand its suitability as a 3D model system to mimic treatment-resistant mesenchymal (MES) type of GBM cells that reside in specific niches of the GBM microenvironment. Cells cultured in 3D-GMH showed higher infiltrative and invasive potential and increased chemo resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) compared to cells cultured on 2 D platform. Further, the 3D-GMH system enriched treatment-resistant mesenchymal cells that resembled the cells found in the perivascular and perinecrotic zones of glioblastoma tumors (Shah et al., 2021)",
