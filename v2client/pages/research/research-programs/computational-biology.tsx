      "Mutations in the IDH gene are known to indicate better prognosis for patients suffering from lower-grade glioma. Current pathology practice of detecting the mutation using immunohistochemistry can only detect the canonical mutations. In this project, we aim to develop a artificial neural network based computational model that can detect both canonical and non-canonical mutations from histopathology images that are generated as part of standard of care.",

    aboutProject:
      "Through successive waves of COVID-19, it is now well-established that around 5-10% of infected patients progress to severe form of disease and other factors like age and pre-existing illnesses increases the chance of severity. In this study, we have analyzed a plethora of publicly available data to establish a set of cytokine markers like IL-6 and IL-10 that be used as prognostic indicator. We also showed that inflammation and hypercoagulopathy are the pre-dominant risk factors of severity for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients suffering from diabetes.",

            The Computational Biology group was established recently at MSMF
            with a mandate to utilize computational and statistical techniques
            including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
            algorithms for processing clinical, molecular and medical image data
            to generate hypotheses towards validation and translation to clinic
            as diagnostics, prognostics or therapeutics. Currently the group is
            working on projects in the area of head and neck and oncology and
            neuro-oncology towards identification of novel biomarkers through
            integration of multi-omic data. In another realm of research,
            members of computational biology group are analysing images of
            routinely acquired histopathology slides to uncover hidden patterns
            that link to a clinically important subtype in brain tumours or to
            therapy sensitivity in lung carcinoma. All these projects could
            potentially lead to a diagnostic or prognostic test in clinic that
            can aid the clinicians augmenting the disease management regime.
