            Children who are taking cancer treatment are away for a long time
            from school and friends. MSCC has a playroom for the children
            providing them with entertainment options during their hospital
            stay. MSMF has provided children with some board games, indoor
            games, books and toys so their stay in the hospital is made more
            interesting and fun filled during their free time. We initiate
            volunteer activities for children where people from different walks
            of life take part in creating memorable moments for the children. We
            organize Christmas program for children every year, when the whole
            team comes together to entertain children with music, dance, games
            and gifts. The activities for children are also a calming experience
            for the parents who are always at the bedside of their children.

            Drugs are a crucial part of every treatment. When it comes to
            periodic intake of drugs that last for several months, it creates a
            financial burden on the patients’ families. MSMF has formed an
            oncology drug discount program to support underprivileged patients
            to procure medicines at discounted rates. The program has helped
            numerous patients to continue treatment without stopping mid-way,
            when they reach a financial crisis.

            Nutritional Support

            Nutrition plays a great role in a person’s daily life and it is
            essential for a healthy living; particularly for patients undergoing
            cancer treatment. Most of the patients who come for treatment are
            from below poverty line and underprivileged families who cannot
            afford a well- balanced nutritional diet as they struggle to make
            ends meet. MSMF supports such patients during their chemotherapy
            sessions by providing them with a healthy balanced diet (bananas,
            almonds and threptin diskettes). We regularly provide support for
            around 800 patients every month and we continue to do so until the
            completion of their treatment.

            Health care is many a times a luxury that a majority on the country
            cannot afford. MSMF, with the support of the medical practitioners
            identifies patients who need financial and emotional support in
            going initiating and completing treatment. The hospital team along
            with social workers guide patients to avail support from various
            government programs and crowdfunding platforms. However these
            options are often time consuming and it is critical for the
            treatment to start at the earliest. MSMF with the help of our
            generous donors lends a helping hand to those patients in need. We
            reach out to people in an exclusive manner thereby enabling
            healthier and happier lives.
